skill-match-api is an API to feed live JSON data of Parks and Recreation Centers in the Las Vegas area.

It is designed to be used by a front-end team of developers to create web applications for local municipalities.

A description for some of the features and endpoints is coming soon.

For now you can see some of the HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) at the following link. It may take up to 30 seconds to load, as it is a free Heroku app.

## Some features of the application as a whole.

- Search with ease for parks/courts in your area. Search by name, zip code or location. Filter by sport or search Parks and see easily with icons what sports are available at each park.

- Create a meet-up at a local park in your area. You can schedule a Tennis, Basketball, Football, Soccer, ^Pickleball, or Other match.

- Each Player has an individual profile. On this profile you can find their Skill (per sport) and Sportsmanship levels on a 1-100 scale. This is especially helpful when seeking a heads-up match, such as Tennis.

- Feedback is provided using a simple 3-slider bars: rating their opponents Skill, Sportsmanship, and Crowd Level. Crowd Level is a slider ranking(1-5) how crowded the court was. All the way to the left if it is wide open. All the way to the right if it is unavailable. This could provide useful information as to when courts are available and busy.


^Pickleball is a game similar to Tennis, played with a ball similar to a heavy wiffle ball. We are looking to build something specific for Henderson, NV.
