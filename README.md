The customer is Parks and Recreation across America. Municipalities who are interested in increasing the use and function of public facilities.

Search with ease for parks/courts in your area. Search by name, zip code or location. Filter by sport or search Parks and see easily with icons what sports are available at each park.

Create a meet-up at a local park in your area. You can schedule a Tennis, Basketball, Football, Soccer, ^Pickleball, or Other match.

Each Player has an individual profile. On this profile you can find their Skill (per sport) and Sportsmanship levels on a 1-100 scale. This is especially helpful when seeking a heads-up match, such as Tennis.

Feedback is provided using a simple 3-slider bars: rating their opponents Skill, Sportsmanship, and Crowd Level

Crowd Level is a slider ranking(1-5) how crowded the court was. All the way to the left if it is wide open. All the way to the right if it is unavailable. This could provide useful information as to when courts are available and busy.


^Pickleball is a game similar to Tennis, played with a ball similar to a heavy wiffle ball. We are looking to build something specific for Henderson, NV.
